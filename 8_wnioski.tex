% Summarize the key findings of your research and restate the thesis statement.

% If some of the models you tested didn't work well, it's important to 
% acknowledge this in your thesis and discuss the reasons why these models 
% failed to perform as expected. Here are some suggestions for how to 
% approach this in your writing:

% Discuss the limitations of the models: Explain any limitations 
% of the models that may have impacted their performance. This could 
% include issues related to data quality or quantity, inappropriate 
% algorithmic choices, or parameter settings.

% Identify areas for improvement: Based on your analysis of the models, 
% identify areas where improvements could be made in future research. 
% This could include exploring different algorithms, feature engineering, 
% or using alternative data sources.

% Provide a critical analysis: Provide a critical analysis of the models 
% that did not perform well, highlighting both their strengths and limitations. 
% Be honest and transparent about the performance of these models, and 
% explain how this impacts the overall results of your research.

% Discuss the implications for your research: Discuss the implications 
% of the poor performance of some of the models for your research question 
% and the field of weather prediction in general. Consider how these 
% results may impact future research or the practical applications 
% of these techniques.
