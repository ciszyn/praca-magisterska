The Dynamic Integrated
foreCasting (DICast®) System was one of the first automated
weather forecasting engines. It is now in use in quite a few
companies with many applications. Some applications being
accomplished at NCAR that include DICast and other artificial
intelligence technologies include renewable energy, surface
transportation, and wildland fire forecasting.
Such applications include hydrometeorological forecasting for
agricultural decision support [2], forecasting road weather to
enhance the safety of surface transportation [3-5], forecasting
movement of wildland fires, and predicting wind [6] and solar
power [7] for utilities and grid operators to facilitate grid
integration. An example of using multiple AI methods for targeted
forecasts is predicting solar power production.

The Paris Agreement [3 ] is
a legally binding  international treaty on climate change. Its goal is
to limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 ◦ C, compared to pre-industrial
levels. In Europe, the Green Deal [4] aims to bring the net emission of greenhouse gasses to
zero by 2050.

Given a new weather situation, it assigns a scalar
value of condence to medium range forecasts initialised from said
atmospheric state, indicating whether the predictability is higher or
lower than usual for the time of the year. While our method has
a lower skill than ensemble weather forecast models in predicting
forecast uncertainty, it is computationally very ecient and outper-
forms a range of alternative methods that do not involve performing
numerical forecasts.
