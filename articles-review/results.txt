It is typical for DICast to outperform the best
individual model by 10-15%, which is considered a large
improvement in weather forecasting. One advantage of DICast
is that it can be trained on a relatively limited dataset (as little
as 30 to 90 days) and updates dynamically to include the most
recent forecast information.

the performance of the DL nowcasting, compared to reference radar observations, is superior
to a convection-permitting NWP with radar data assimilation.

Compared to the NWP baseline, Reference [ 55 ] improved the forecast for temperature
by 24.4%, for relative humidity by 12.4% and for wind speed by 6.2%. Reference [55] used
a combination of a Spatiotemporal Attention Network (STAN) and a Multilayer Perceptron
(MLP).
Compared to the NWP baseline, Reference [ 56 ] improved the forecast for temperature
by 17.0% and for relative humidity by 9.7%. Reference [56 ] used a combination of Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs)

Among the various tools,
we have chosen linear regression technique. One
thing which is to be done mandatorily by the user is
to update the previous day’s weather paramaters or
else the module fails to apply linear regression to
predict, as every tool dealing with machine learning
involves the constant renewal of past data. (3.5% deviation for the next day)

e accuracy of ML models, namely MLP-NN, RBF-NN, G.B.T., L.R. and R.F., were investigated to predict air
temperatures and relative humidity in dierent time horizons (daily and monthly) using historical meteorological
data. Dierent input combinations were investigated with varying times of lag. e results showed that MLP-NN
is a leading algorithm compared with other models in predicting monthly relative humidity with a correlation
coecient equal to 0.8462

The professional weather forecasting service consis-
tently outperformed our models across all seven days,
with a large discrepancy in earlier days and a small dis-
crepancy in later days. This was expected since the phys-
ical models of the atmosphere can be accurately solved
for short time periods, but the instability of the physi-
cal models causes errors to accumulate quickly for longer
time periods. On the contrary, machine learning algo-
rithms are robust to perturbations in initial conditions,
and over longer periods of time, perhaps our models
would outperform the professional weather forecasting
services.

the deterministic forecasts of the Integrated
Forecast System provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts
maintains an anomaly correlation coefcient of the 500 hPa geopotential height of 80% for about
7 days, while the root-mean square error for 2 m temperature predictions of 72 h forecasts is close
to 2 K [21]. Larger scale high-impact events such as hurricane tracks can be predicted with an
accuracy of 150 km up to 4 days in advance

Some recent studies explored the BDL concept for weather forecasting applications. A model
built on GRU and 3D CNN, along with variational Bayesian inference for estimating posterior
parameter distributions, has been presented by Liu et al. [141] for probabilistic wind speed
forecasting of up to 3 h. A study from Vandal et al. [92] demonstrates the use of BDL to capture
the uncertainty from observation data and unknown model parameters in the context of statistical
downscaling of precipitation forecasts. These are relevant contributions, but a lot remains to be
done before the uncertainty of DL weather forecasts can be assessed at a level similar to current
NWP ensemble systems

Whether DL will evolve enough to replace most or all of the current NWP
systems cannot be answered at this point.


comparison-of-machine-learning-methods

This paper presents a comparison of 24 easy-to-applicable machine learning (ML) models for 
day-ahead photovoltaic (PV) power fore- casting based on numerical weather predictions (NWP). 
The models are tested for two-years data of 16 Hungarian ground-mounted PV plants and evaluated 
by five commonly used verification metrics. In addition to the models, the selection of the 
predictors and the significance of the hyperparameter are also examined. The main findings 
of this study are summarized as follows:
The overall most accurate model is kernel ridge (KR), but it has an extremely long training time 
and high memory usage. The multilayer perceptron (MLP, the basic type of feedforward neural networks) 
has an almost identical accuracy with significantly lower training time; thus, this model is 
recommended for practical applications. How- ever, KR is worthy for further, more specified investigations.
• Input data selection is even more important than model selection. Extending the basic NWP outputs with the 
angles calculated from the position of the Sun (elevation, azimuth, and declination) and the time-shifted and 
averaged versions of the global horizontal irradi- ance (GHI) leads to an RMSE reduction of 13.1% compared to the
basic input case that only uses the GHI, ambient temperature and wind speed as predictors. Moreover, using only 
daily mean GHI forecasts and the Sun position angles as predictors increases RMSE by only 1.5% compared to the 
best input case that relies on a full set of 15-min GHI forecasts. In other words, the added value of high- 
resolution irradiance forecasts is limited for PV power forecasting in a day-ahead time horizon.
Hyperparameter tuning is essential to exploit the full potential of the ML models, as the best RMSE achieved without 
tuning is 3.1% higher than the best with tuning. The more robust models (e.g., MLP, gradient boosting regressor) 
are quite accurate even without tuning, while for some other models (e.g., lasso, decision tree), training is a must, 
as they have enormous errors with their default parameters. Overall, tuning equalizes the RMSE of the different models 
compared to the default case.
The overall best results (tuned KR or MLP with the complex pre- dictors) has 13.9% lower RMSE than the simplest 
solution, i.e., the linear regression fitted on the basic NWP data. The importance of the ML model and input 
selection falls into the same range as model chain selection for physical irradiance-to-power conversion [10].

This complete paper narrates different data
mining techniques and methodology for weather

the support vector machine algorithm can gives better
weather prediction with higher than 90% accuracy
and provides better result

One of the
key parameter choices was nding a good balance between the smoothness and
sharpness of the forecasts. Biasing toward smoothness resulted in predictions
clustering near the average solar irradiance value, which led to underestimation
of both clear and cloudy days. All statistical models struggled at capturing the
right number of cloudy and partly cloudy events, which is due to errors in the un-
derlying NWP forecasts and the assumptions underlying the statistical learning
models. Further explorations of data transformations, sample weighting, and
loss functions are needed to capture the crucial extreme events better. Given
the bounded nature of solar irradiance and clearness index, more performance
improvements should be possible


an-efficient-weather-forecasting

This approach is able to determine the non-
linear relationship that exists between the historical data
(temperature, wind speed, humidity, etc.,) supplied to the
system during the training phase and on that basis, make a
prediction of what the temperature would be in future.


applications-in-atmospheric-environments

AI applications for the atmospheric environment verify the high efficiency of the algorithms,
and also reveal their unique ability to extract knowledge from the scientific domain of interest and
to help us understand and manage environmental problems. On this basis, it would be recommended
that such an analysis be carried out in cases where problems related to the atmospheric environment
and quality of life are concerned, in order to better inform policy and decision makers about the
constrains of their decisions. In addition, such methods may provide services related to public noti-
fication, warning and alerts with the necessary scientific competence, on the basis of forecasts.


development-and-applications-ml-in

The idea in current research applying ML models to atmospheric prediction is to stay at
the application level. Most research has simply used ML models as a “black box” predictor
or added sophisticated designs as a data processor, e.g., variable selection or transforma-
tion [ 123 –127 ], predicted target decomposition [128 –132 ], and spatiotemporal information
addition [107 , 133 – 136 ]. Another application method is the ensemble approach [137 , 138 ].
Few studies have improved the internal structure of predictive models according to spe-
cic atmospheric pollution problems. In the articial intelligence eld, many classical DL
structure models have been proposed based on specic problems, such as target detection
(faster R-CNN algorithm) [139] and semantic segmentation (FCN algorithm) [140]. When
considering atmospheric pollution prediction, ML models also need “customization” for
model structure design, rather than simply designing the pre-process for input data and
predictive targets, or hyperparameter optimization modication inside ML models.
