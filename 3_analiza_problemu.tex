% Describe the methodology adopted for the research, 
% including the data collection methods, techniques used 
% for data preprocessing, and the selection of the algorithms 
% used for weather prediction

% The methodology section of your thesis is where you describe the 
% methods and procedures used to conduct your research. It should 
% provide sufficient detail to allow others to replicate your study 
% and evaluate the validity and reliability of your results. Here are 
% some important elements to consider including in your methodology section:

% Limitations: Describe any limitations or potential sources of 
% bias in your study, and how these were addressed or minimized.

% Overall, the methodology section of your thesis should provide a 
% clear and detailed description of the methods and procedures 
% used to conduct your research. It should also provide 
% justification for the choices made, and explain how these choices 
% contributed to the validity and reliability of your results.
