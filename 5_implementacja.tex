% Software and tools used: Explain the software and tools you used for 
% your implementation. This could include programming languages, libraries, 
% frameworks, or any other tools that you found useful.

% Data preparation: Discuss the data preparation steps you took, 
% including data cleaning, feature selection, and data normalization. 
% Explain how you handled missing values and outliers, and any techniques 
% used to preprocess the data.

% Model development: Explain how you developed the models used for your 
% analysis. Discuss the algorithmic choices and parameter settings, 
% as well as any tuning or optimization steps.

% Evaluation metrics: Describe the evaluation metrics you used to 
% measure the performance of your models. Explain why you chose these 
% metrics and how they relate to the research question or problem.

% Results and analysis: Present the results of your implementation, and 
% discuss their implications. Explain how the results align with your research 
% objectives, and provide a critical analysis of the strengths and limitations 
% of your approach.

% Code availability: Consider making your code available to others, 
% and provide a link or repository where readers can access the code 
% you developed. This can facilitate replication of your research and 
% allow others to build upon your work.
