\section{Wyniki}

% Descriptive statistics: Provide descriptive statistics that 
% summarize the main characteristics of your data, such as means, 
% standard deviations, and frequency distributions.
\subsection{Statystyki}

% Inferential statistics: Report the results of any inferential 
% statistical analyses that you conducted to test your research 
% hypotheses, such as t-tests, ANOVA, regression analysis, or 
% other statistical tests. Be sure to include the statistical 
% significance of the results and the effect sizes.
\subsection{Testy statystyczne}

% Tables and figures: Present your data in tables and figures 
% that are clear, concise, and easy to read. Ensure that your 
% tables and figures are properly labeled and that they effectively 
% illustrate your findings.

% Subgroup analyses: Conduct subgroup analyses if relevant to 
% your research questions. For example, if you are comparing the 
% performance of different machine learning models, you might conduct 
% subgroup analyses based on the type of model used or the size of the training data.
